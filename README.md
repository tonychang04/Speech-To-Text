This is a project that allows users to record their speech, automatically convert it to text, and then translate the text to the given language. I created this project because coming from a family that doesn't speak english, my family often doesn't communicate well with people speaking English. I created this app in hope to assist their transition to using English to communicate. Although this app is definitely not perfect, I learned a lot of libraries related to speech-to-text. Also, I utilized the Kivy framework to create an app, which is really fun in the process too.

## Usage

To run the application:
```console
python -m app
```
Then press the button called record then start speaking.

If you don't want to run the application with a GUI, use:
```console
python other.py
```
Then start speaking. Press the keyboard letter 'r' when you are done speaking.

## **Dependencies**
* Google Trans
* Keyboard
* Kivy
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Sound Device
* Sound File
* SpeechRecognition

## **Installation**
After you clone the respository, navigate to the project directory and run:
```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Future Possible Functionalities**
* Add a timer so the user know when the recording will end
* Create a better UI 
* Allow custom duration of recording instead of constant recording
