# Speech-To-Text


This is a project that allows user to record their speech, and then it 
automatically converts it to text, then translate the text to the given language.
I created this project because coming from a family that doesn't speak english, my family often doesn't 
communicate well with people speaking english. I created this app in hope to assist their transition
of using english to comminicate. Although this app is definitely not perfect, but I learned a lot of
libraries related to speech-to-text. Also, I utilized Kivy framework to create an app, which is really fun 
in the process too.
